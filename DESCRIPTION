Description: In network analysis, many community detection algorithms have been developed. However, their applications leave unaddressed one important question: the statistical validation of the results. robin (ROBustness In Network) is an R package for the validation of community detection. It has a double aim: to study the robustness of a community detection algorithm and to compare the robustness of different community detection algorithms on the same network.
